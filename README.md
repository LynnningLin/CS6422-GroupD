# Project: Smart Home Thermostat Controller

Temperature control: It would continuously monitor the room temperature and adjust it to the user's preference by turning the AC/heater on or off. 
In economy mode, it would first try to open windows or curtains to regulate the temperature before using energy.

Energy-saving feature: It could use a combination of millimeter wave sensors and Bluetooth detectors 
(inspired by this quick YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snVQHsnG_V4â€”itâ€™s only 7 minutes long, no pressureðŸ¤¡!). 
The system would adjust the temperature when it detects activity, and if no one is home, it wouldnâ€™t turn on the AC at all.

Integration with other smart devices: To take it a step further, it could integrate with other smart home systems, like lighting, to create more customized and futuristic modes for users.
