Todo:
1. <!-- <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="1"> --> shouldn't apply for setting page
2. /homepage pictures change according to detection
    2.1 Occupation: User input in settings can enable or stop the change
    2.2 HVAC movement
    2.3 HVAC on and off
3. /rooms temperature change
4. /settings target temperature validate
    4.1 field is required (I don't know why it doesn't work) 
        (If I can't fix it, when we demonstrate it make sure every time we go to /settings, set the target temperature)
    4.2 when it is economy mode, Target temperature can be set only in [19, 23]

Done:
1. /homepage shows default/economy mode
2. /homepage shows target temperature
